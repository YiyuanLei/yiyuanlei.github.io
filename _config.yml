  Hello! I am a graduate research assistant at New York University. I obtained my Master's degree in Statistics and Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is about proactive traffic safety evaluation and management. 
  I am interested in <mark>Causal Inference</mark>, <mark>Statistical Learning</mark>, and <mark>Stochastic Process</mark>. 
  Please see my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-pXDUYYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for my publications. My past coursework can be found [here](http://publish.illinois.edu/yiyuanlei/).

          - Quantifying the short-term and long-term impacts of the “stay-at-home” policy.
          - Data-driven approaches using regression discontinuity design and propensity score matching method.
          - The bike-sharing system and yellow taxi system have different sensitivities to the policy.
          - Policy implications are derived from the robust analyses.

            Proactive retention strategies using machine learning models
            - Initiated Uber membership churning behavior diagnostics and analysis using SQL and Python
            - Proposed proactive retention strategies using machine learning models (e.g. lightGBM) to retain users.
            - Designed a memory-based recursion algorithm to preprocess queried data for duration analysis.
            - Applied Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox PH model to identify the churning patterns by cohorts.
            - Performed feature engineering, model selection to improve classification accuracy for 85% users.
            - Collaborated with cross-functional (e.g. Product, Engineering) teams on deep dive analysis and debugging.
