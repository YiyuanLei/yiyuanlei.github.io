  Hello! I am a graduate research assitant at New York University. I obtained my master degree in Statistics and Civil Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research is about proactive traffic safety evaluation and management. 
  I am interested in <mark>Causal Inference</mark>, <mark>Statistical Learning</mark> and <mark>Stochastic Process</mark>. 
  Please see my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-pXDUYYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for my publications.

          - Quantifying the short-term and long-term impacts of the "stay-at-home" policy.
          - Data-driven approaches using regression dicontinuity design and propensity score matching method.
          - The bike-sharing system and yellow taxi system have different sensitivies to the policy.
          - Policy implications are derived from the robust analyses.
